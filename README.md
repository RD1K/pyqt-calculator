You can try it out by installing the PyQt5 library using PIP. After you do that, you can clone this repository and run the main file, calculator.py.

The calc.ui file contains the XML code for the user interface, created with Qt Designer.

The simplemath.py file contains the code for determining which math operation is necessary, and using it.
